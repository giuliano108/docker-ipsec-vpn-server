Docker image to run an IPsec VPN server, with support for both `IPsec/L2TP` and `IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec")`.

Based on Debian Jessie with [Libreswan](https://libreswan.org) (IPsec VPN software) and [xl2tpd](https://github.com/xelerance/xl2tpd) (L2TP daemon).

This docker image is based on [Lin Song work](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server) and adds those features:

* Multiple VPN users declaration support
=======
*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [简体中文](README-zh.md).*

## Install Docker

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) to get Docker running on your server.

## Download

Get the trusted build from the [Docker Hub registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server):

```
docker pull hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server
```

or download and compile the source yourself from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server.git
cd docker-ipsec-vpn-server
docker build -t hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server .
```

or use this if not modifying the source code:

```
docker build -t hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server.git
```

## How to use this image

### Environment variables

This Docker image uses the following three environment variables, that can be declared in an `env` file:

```
VPN_IPSEC_PSK=<IPsec pre-shared key>
VPN_USER_CREDENTIAL_LIST=[{"login":"userTest1","password":"test1"},{"login":"userTest2","password":"test2"}]
```

The IPsec PSK (pre-shared key) is specified by the `VPN_IPSEC_PSK` environment variable.
Multiple user is supported. VPN user credentials is defined in `VPN_USER_CREDENTIAL_LIST` environnement variable.
Users login and password must be defined in a json format array. Each user should be define with a "login" and a "password" attribute. 

**Note:** In your `env` file, DO NOT put single or double quotes around values, or add space around `=`. Also, DO NOT use these characters within values: `\ " '`

All the variables to this image are optional, which means you don't have to type in any environment variable, and you can have an IPsec VPN server out of the box! Read the sections below for details.

### Start the IPsec VPN server

First, run this command on the Docker host to load the IPsec `NETKEY` kernel module:

```
sudo modprobe af_key
```

Start a new Docker container with the following command (replace `./vpn.env` with your own `env` file) :

```
docker run \
    --name ipsec-vpn-server \
    --env-file ./vpn.env \
    -p 500:500/udp \
    -p 4500:4500/udp \
    -p 1701:1701/udp \
    -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro \
    -d --privileged \
    --restart always \
    -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
    -v /var/log/dockerlog/weenove-vpn:/var/log\
    hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server

```

### Retrieve VPN login details

If you did not set environment variables via an `env` file, a vpn user login will default to `vpnuser` and both `VPN_IPSEC_PSK` and vpn user password will be randomly generated. To retrieve them, show the logs of the running container:

```
docker logs ipsec-vpn-server
```

Search for these lines in the output:

```
Connect to your new VPN with these details:

Server IP: <VPN Server IP>
IPsec PSK: <IPsec pre-shared key>
Users credentials :
Login : <vpn user_login> Password : <vpn user_password>
```

### Check server status

To check the status of your IPsec VPN server, you can pass `ipsec status` to your container like this:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ipsec status
```

## Next Steps

Get your computer or device to use the VPN. Please refer to:

[Configure IPsec/L2TP VPN Clients](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md)   
[Configure IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") VPN Clients](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients-xauth.md)

Enjoy your very own VPN! :sparkles::tada::rocket::sparkles:

## Technical Details

There are two services running: `Libreswan (pluto)` for the IPsec VPN, and `xl2tpd` for L2TP support.

Clients are configured to use [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) when the VPN connection is active.

The default IPsec configuration supports:

* IKEv1 with PSK and XAuth ("Cisco IPsec")
* IPsec/L2TP with PSK

The ports that are exposed for this container to work are:

* 4500/udp and 500/udp for IPsec
